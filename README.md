# 🧠 Aryan's DSA Progress Tracker

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms progress tracker!  
I'm currently following Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet to prepare for interviews at top product-based companies.

This repository is a structured log of my problem-solving journey across various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeStudio.

## ✅ Today's Problems Solved
| # | **Problem**                          | **Approach Used**                           | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
| - | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1 | Detect Cycle in Linked List          | Floyd’s Cycle Detection (Tortoise & Hare)   | `O(n)`              | `O(1)`               |
| 2 | Count Length of Cycle in Linked List | Floyd’s Algorithm + Counting Nodes          | `O(n)`              | `O(1)`               |
| 3 | Check if Linked List is Palindrome   | Find Mid → Reverse Second Half → Compare    | `O(n)`              | `O(1)`               |
| 4 | Odd Even Linked List                 | Two-pointer technique (Odd/Even separation) | `O(n)`              | `O(1)`               |
