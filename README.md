# 🧠 Aryan's DSA Progress Tracker

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms progress tracker!  
I'm currently following Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet to prepare for interviews at top product-based companies.

This repository is a structured log of my problem-solving journey across various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeStudio.

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings

🗒️ I maintain short markdown notes on patterns, templates, and tricky problems in the `/Notes` folder.

### 🔹 Key Takeaways (Recent)

- 📌 *Isomorphic Strings:* Learned to use bi-directional hash maps to enforce one-to-one character mapping.
- 📌 *Longest Common Prefix:* Practiced prefix trimming logic using substr and horizontal scanning pattern.
