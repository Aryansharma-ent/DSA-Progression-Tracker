# 🧠 Aryan's DSA Progress Tracker

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms progress tracker!  
I'm currently following Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet to prepare for interviews at top product-based companies.

This repository is a structured log of my problem-solving journey across various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeStudio.

## ✅ Today's Problems Solved
| # | Problem Title                      | File Name                       | Approach Summary                                                                                   | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| - | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s in Linked List | `sort-0s-1s-2s-linked-list.cpp` | Create 3 dummy lists (`zero`, `one`, `two`) → Traverse and partition nodes → Merge the lists       | O(n)            | O(1)             |
| 2 | Intersection of Two Linked Lists   | `intersection-of-ll.cpp`        | Two-pointer technique → Traverse both → Switch heads to align → Meet at intersection or null       | O(n + m)        | O(1)             |
| 3 | Add One to Linked List             | `add-one-to-linked-list.cpp`    | Recursive reverse carry propagation from tail → Modify node values → Add new head if carry remains | O(n)            | O(n) (stack)     |
