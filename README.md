# 🧠 Aryan's DSA Progress Tracker

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms progress tracker!  
I'm currently following Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet to prepare for interviews at top product-based companies.

This repository is a structured log of my problem-solving journey across various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeStudio.

## ✅ Today's Problems Solved
| Problem | Platform / No. | Pattern | Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | File Name |
|---------|----------------|---------|----------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Next Greater Element I | LeetCode 496 | Monotonic Stack | Use a monotonic decreasing stack + hash map to precompute next greater for `nums2`, then lookup for each `nums1` element. | O(m + n) | O(n) | `next_greater_element_I.cpp` |
| Next Greater Element II | LeetCode 503 | Monotonic Stack (Circular) | Simulate circularity by iterating `2 * n` times in reverse with a monotonic decreasing stack to find next greater elements. | O(n) | O(n) | `next_greater_element_II.cpp` |




## 🧠 Notes & Learnings

🗒️ I maintain short markdown notes on patterns, templates, and tricky problems in the `/Notes` folder.

### 🔹 Key Takeaways (Recent)

- 📌 Recursion and Backtracking questions
