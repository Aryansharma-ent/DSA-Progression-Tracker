Problem:
LeetCode 1423 â€“ Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
You are given an integer array cardPoints and an integer k.
You can pick exactly k cards from either end of the array.
Return the maximum score you can obtain.

Approach:
1. Total score of picked cards = Total sum of all cards - Sum of the unpicked subarray.
2. Since we must pick k cards from ends, we are effectively leaving (n - k) consecutive cards.
3. Find the minimum sum subarray of length (n - k) using sliding window.
4. Answer = totalSum - minSubarraySum.

Steps:
- Compute total sum of the array.
- Use sliding window of size (n - k) to find the minimum subarray sum.
- Subtract this from total sum.

Complexity:
- Time: O(n), each element is visited once while summing and once in sliding window.
- Space: O(1), only variables used.
